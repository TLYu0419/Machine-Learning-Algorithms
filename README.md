# Machine-Learning-Algorithms
At Data Science Dojo, our mission is to make data science (machine learning in this case) available to everyone. Whether you join our [data science bootcamp](https://datasciencedojo.com/data-science-bootcamp/), read our blog, or [watch our tutorials](https://tutorials.datasciencedojo.com/), we want everyone to have the opportunity to learn data science.  Having said that, each accordion dropdown is embeddable if you want to take them with you. All you have to do is click the little 'embed' button in the lower left-hand corner and copy/paste the iframe. All we ask is you link back to this post.  By the way, if you have trouble with Medium/TDS, just throw your browser into incognito mode.
